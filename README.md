# Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the study and application of audio signal processing techniques for machine learning. The focus of this project is on understanding and implementing various audio signal processing techniques that are fundamental in audio data analysis and machine learning applications such as speech recognition, music classification, and sound event detection.

## Topics Covered
- **Basic Audio Signal Representation**
    - Introduction to audio signals and their representation in time and frequency domains.
- **Signal Processing Techniques**
    - Filtering, noise reduction, and smoothing techniques.
    - Spectral analysis, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and spectrograms.
- **Feature Extraction**
    - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Chroma features, and more.
- **Amplitude Envelope Calculation**
    - Methods to extract the amplitude envelope using RMS and other techniques.
- **Machine Learning Integration**
    - Using audio features in machine learning models for classification and regression tasks.

## Notebooks
